This change log is for the WALY library itself.

8 February 2013
- fixed a bug with use of empty text in WALYWidget.cpp

3 February 2013
- set distinct values for SDLK constants in Android SDL stubs to avoid
  errors with duplicate case values (constants taken from SDL headers)

2 February 2013
- enabled application definition of screen size, but screen size must
  be static for lifetime of application for now (and WebOS is not prepared
  to handle anything other than 320x480 yet)
- 1000x1500 doesn't work in landscape on Android...not clear why...no, you
  know, actual *** error message *** or anything.  (logcat spits out some
  random internal failure...not terribly useful, since one can't predict
  it from the actual API calls...those all succeed: setBuffersGeometry,
  native window lock gives correctly sized buffer, but then distorts it
  when putting on the screen...great.)   Oh, joy, it can't even handle
  the full screen size of Android.  That's just great.  Seems to handle
  500x800 (so it doesn't have to scale down if you turn it sideways).
  I may have to try twiddling the "SurfaceHolder" (of the native activity's
  window?  but I need to use the right thread) and call setFixedSize

28 January 2013
- tried to fix the rest of the 64-bit issues based on copy from student's 
  machine; could be cleaner with mapping from queue_elt_t fields to 
  void* in events...

22 January 2013
- found about 10-12 conversion errors (or warnings) on recent installation
  of 64-bit Ubuntu this morning (student's machine); was able to get three
  of them on the EWS machines with Linux build, so got rid of those;
  need to find the others again

19 January 2013
- used Java reflection to support Android-14 by falling back on display
  getMetrics when getRealMetrics (Android-17 call) is missing
- made more aggressive about dealing with Android's stale decorview
  (was waiting for a real event, such a mousedown...effectively was making
  sure that user saw the stale results in skewed appearance)

12 January 2013
- fixed bug with connection to Android's hideKeyboard method (was getting
  the showKeyboard method instead)
- only API level 14 of Android (OS 4.0+, Ice Cream Sandwich) is needed
  for WALY; that level is the first with OpenSLES support, so that level
  is necessary
