    //
    // there's a nice visual explanation (at time of writing!) of the
    //    events that Android sends to apps at
    //    developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html
    //
    // The only event that guarantees that the app is ending is DESTROY,
    //    and DESTROY is not necessarily even delivered (can be killed
    //    without the call), so there's never a good time to actually
    //    shut down gracefully in Android.
    //
    // Thus, I don't actually send SDL_QUIT (and WALY_main never returns).
    //
    // So long as we save state on PAUSE and re-load state when the app
    //    starts, we can just let Android clobber the app if it wants...
    //    (and go to sleep on PAUSE, of course).
    //

    // finish SDL_QUIT
    WALYFinishEvent();

    Platform::detach();

    //
    // Who knows what those people were thinking?
    //
    // What they (Android developers) seem to have done is this:
    //
    // android_main returns, and the program is ... sort of dead
    //
    // but it's not really dead...it's just hibernating...
    //
    // static destructors DO NOT GET CALLED
    //
    // so you either (A) have to make sure that your program is
    // re-entrant to main (CONSTRUCTORS won't get called again
    // either...) or (B) do the following
    exit(3);
