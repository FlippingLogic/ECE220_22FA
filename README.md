### Anything that the downloaders of those files do which violates UIUC Academic Intergrity should be responsibility of the downloaders themselves, If some issues related to academic intergrity did happen, I will do my best cooperating with UIUC or ZJU staffs.

mp storage for ECE220, offered in 2022 fall semester, ZJU-UIUC institute.

    This repository is created only for self-storage. 
    Since the backup provided by the school may be recalled, and the memory of the virtual machine is limited.

I'm more than happy to share my idea and coding experience with you, if it's allowed by your college's code. ECE220 is one of my favourate course! (ECE120 is better for me so far, haha.) Hope you enjoy taking this course. Coding is quite easy and fun here.

mp9 is still my favourate mp in ECE220, the algorithm used and the project I built always make me feel proud. 
mp11 is very very very time consuming and it's not well decribed, I don't like this one. Hope you're patient enough.
mp12 is optional and it provides extra credit! It's highly recommended! Easy and fun! (Don't worry about C++, that's not the point of mp12.)

#### No guarantee of correctness. Only few mps here got the full mark. Be careful!

Good luck, my fellow students!
