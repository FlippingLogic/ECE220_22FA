 * The print_row function determines which pixels are known to be black
 * in one row of a nonogram, then prints a line indicating those pixels.
 * Up to four region sizes are given as r1, r2, r3, r4 (0 means a 
 * non-existent region, and r1 must exist).  width is the number of
 * pixels in the row.  The row is printed using X to denote known black
 * pixels, and period ('.') to denote other pixels.  Finally, the 
 * function returns 1 for success, or 0 if the regions cannot fit within
 * the specified width.
